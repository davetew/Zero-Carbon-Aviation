# Zero-Carbon-Aviation
This repository is intended to contain the evaluation of several potential options for zero-carbon aviation propulsion systems.  These options are expected to include--
1.  Traditional (e.g. Li Ion) batteries
2.  Carbon-neutral liquid fuels
3.  Metal-Air Batteries

These four propulsion system options will be evaluated in four different types of commercial passenger aircraft--
1. Regional Turboprop (e.g. Bombardier Dash 8)
2. Regional Jet (e.g. Airbus A200)
3. Single Aisle (e.g. Boeing 737)
4. Twin Aisle (e.g. Boeing 777)
