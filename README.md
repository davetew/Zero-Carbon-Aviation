# Zero-Carbon-Aviation
This repository contains a combination of Colab notebooks and Python functions and classes that are being developed to facilitate the evaluation of climate-friendly aviation propulsion systems.  The notebooks are being used to develop the functions and classes that will ultimately be incorporated into a Python package.

The focus of the tools will be on the evaluation of impact of different propulsion system architectures on aircraft performance (e.g., traditional turbofan engines and electrified propulsion system architectures).  



These options are expected to include--
1.  Traditional (e.g. Li Ion) batteries
2.  Carbon-neutral liquid fuels
3.  Metal-Air Batteries

These four propulsion system options will be evaluated in four different types of commercial passenger aircraft--
1. Regional Turboprop (e.g. Bombardier Dash 8)
2. Regional Jet (e.g. Airbus A200)
3. Single Aisle (e.g. Boeing 737)
4. Twin Aisle (e.g. Boeing 777)

## Organization
The Zero-Carbon-Aviation analysis tools are organized into several major classes:
1. Fuels
2. Aircraft
3.
