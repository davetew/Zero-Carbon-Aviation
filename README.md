# Zero-Carbon-Aviation
This repository is intended to contain the evaluation of several potential options for zero-carbon aviation propulsion systems.  These options are expected to include--
1.  Traditional (e.g. Li Ion) batteries
2.  Carbon-neutral liquid fuels
3.  Metal-Air Batteries
4.  Nuclear Power
